"""Electric load data accessors

Syntax: `loads [-h] [-y YEAR] [-o OUTPUT] [--building_type BUILDING_TYPE]
[--format {csv,gzip,zip,xlsx}] [--precision PRECISION] [--warning] [--debug] 
state county {residential,commercial,industrial,agricultural,public,weather}`

Positional arguments:

- `state`

- `county`

- `{residential,commercial,industrial,agricultural,public,weather}`O

Options:

-  `-h`, `--help`           show this help message and exit

- `-y`, `--year YEAR`       set load model year

- `-o`, `--output OUTPUT`   set output file name

- `--building_type BUILDING_TYPE`
                            access raw building type stock data

- `--format {csv,gzip,zip,xlsx}`
                            specify output format

- `--precision PRECISION`
                            specify output precision

- `--warning`.              enable warning messages from python

- `--debug`                 enable debug traceback on exceptions

See https://www.eudoxys.com/loads for documentation.

Description:

The `loads` package retrieves data for the following sectors:

- `residential`: based on data from NREL RESstock

- `commercial`: based on data from NREL COMstock

- `industrial`: based on data from NREL's industrial loads inventory

- `agricultural`: based on data from NREL's agricultural loads inventory

In addition corresponding `weather` data is available for the residential and
commercial sector loads that weather sensitive

Data frame generally contain any of the following, indexed by date/time:

- `elec_baseload_MW`: electric loads which are dependent on outdoor air
  temperature and solar gains over all conditions.

- `elec_cooling_MW`: electric loads which are dependent on outdoor air
  temperature only when cooling is required.

- `elec_heating_MW`: electric loads which are dependent on outdoor air
  temperature only when heating is required.

- `elec_total_MW`: total electric loads, i.g., base load plus cooling and
  heating loads.

- `elec_dg_MW`: distribution generation, i.e., negative loads from sources
  such as rooftop photovoltaics and batteries that are discharging.

- `elec_net_MW`: net load, i.e., total including distributed generation.

- `nonelec_baseload_MW`: non-electric loads which are dependent on outdoor air
  temperature and solar gains over all conditions.

- `nonelec_cooling_MW`: non-electric loads which are dependent on outdoor air
  temperature only when cooling is required.

- `nonelec_heating_MW`: non-electric loads which are dependent on outdoor air
  temperature only when heating is required.

- `nonelec_total_MW`: total non-electric loads, i.g., non-electric base load plus cooling and
  heating loads.

Not all data frames will contain all these columns. Columns that are all zeros may be omitted.

Caveats:

- Most of the data comes from online sources that are cached locally to help
  with performance. However, some of the initial downloads can take a several
  minutes to complete before being cached.

- Some residential and commercial building types are not available in some
  counties. In such cases a warning is output and a zero dataframe is
  constructed.
